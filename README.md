This is the client side to an API, a resource to movie information.  Users can create a personal profile for this app.  In their profile, they can view a list of movies and choose/mark any as a 'favorite'.  

To view/add to the project, use the following command:

BASH:
parcel src/index.html

(Note: While developing this app, I ran into specific github branch conflicts/errors.  I tried to start fresh at different points, by making new repos/versions to compensate.  Now that it is fully functional, I created this final repo, 'myFlix-client_5b'.  This is why there are fewer commits for this particular repo.)
