This is the server side to an API, a resource to movie information.  To view/add to the project, use the following command:

BASH:

(Note: While developing this app, I ran into specific github branch conflicts/errors.  I tried to start fresh at different points, by making new repos/versions to compensate.  Now that it is fully functional, I created this final repo, 'myFlix-client_5b'.  This is why there are fewer commits for this particular repo.)
